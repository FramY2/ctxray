## Supported versions

| Version                      | Supported |
| ---------------------------- | --------- |

## Report privately

When the repository is public, use GitHub private vulnerability reporting.
Please do not open a public issue for a vulnerability that could expose prompts,
credentials, account data, or arbitrary file/process access.

Include:

- affected version and operating system;
- minimal reproduction with synthetic data;
- impact and affected command;
- suggested mitigation, if known.

Never include real API keys, cookies, access tokens, private prompts, or session
transcripts. Maintainers will acknowledge a complete report, validate it, and
coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline appropriate to severity.

## Security boundaries

CtxRay is a local developer tool, not a sandbox. It reads the paths selected by
the user and can explicitly install Codex profile files. Run it only in workspaces
and with configuration you trust.
